# LaRA---Alvik-Robot

Hello, and welcome!

We congratulate you on your interest in the educational project on advanced robotics that uses Arduino Alvik. In this space, we will discuss how we tested the development track and show how the Alvik robot works with its implementation codes.

In this project, you will find:

The execution codes for the Alvik robot and the implementation codes for the proposed exercises.

Visual information about the test track and an explanation of how it is can be executed.

You will find a folder with photos of the robot and its modifications.

Another folder contains the .lst files that can be used in 3D printers if you are interested in reproducing this exercise.

As we develop the project, we will post the code and implementations on this page so that you can stay updated with the modifications!

Thank you very much!
